\title{Learning hyper-parameters of a Gaussian Process}
\usage{
train_gp(
  data,
  ini_hp = NULL,
  kern = "SE",
  post_mean = NULL,
  post_cov = NULL,
  pen_diag = 0.01
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A tibble or data frame. Required columns: \code{Input},
\code{Output}. Additional columns for covariates can be specified.
The \code{Input} column should define the variable that is used as
reference for the observations (e.g. time for longitudinal data). The
\code{Output} column specifies the observed values (the response
variable). The data frame can also provide as many covariates as desired,
with no constraints on the column names. These covariates are additional
inputs (explanatory variables) of the models that are also observed at
each reference \code{Input}.}

\item{ini_hp}{A named vector, tibble or data frame of hyper-parameters
associated with the \code{kern} of the new individual/task.
The columns should be named according to the hyper-parameters that are
used in \code{kern}. In cases where the model includes a noise term,
\code{ini_hp} should contain an additional 'noise' column. If NULL
(default), random values are used as initialisation.}

\item{kern}{A kernel function, defining the covariance structure of the GP.
Several popular kernels
(see \href{https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/cookbook/}{The Kernel
Cookbook}) are already implemented and can be selected within the
following list:
\itemize{
\item "SE": (default value) the Squared Exponential Kernel (also called
Radial Basis Function or Gaussian kernel),
\item "LIN": the Linear kernel,
\item "PERIO": the Periodic kernel,
\item "RQ": the Rational Quadratic kernel.
Compound kernels can be created as sums or products of the above kernels.
For combining kernels, simply provide a formula as a character string
where elements are separated by whitespaces (e.g. "SE + PERIO"). As theÂ²
elements are treated sequentially from the left to the right, the product
operator '*' shall always be used before the '+' operators (e.g.
'SE * LIN + RQ' is valid whereas 'RQ + SE * LIN' is  not).
}}

\item{post_mean}{Hyper-posterior mean parameter of the mean GP. Typically,
this argument would come from a previous training using
\code{\link{train_magma}}, but it could also be specified under various
formats, such as:
\itemize{
\item NULL (default). The hyper-posterior mean would be set to 0 everywhere.
\item A number. The hyper-posterior mean would be a constant function.
\item A vector of the same length as all the distinct Input values in the
\code{data} argument. This vector would be considered as the evaluation
of the hyper-posterior mean function at the training Inputs.
\item A function. This function is defined as the hyper-posterior mean.
\item A tibble or data frame. Required columns: Input, Output. The Input
values should include at least the same values as in the \code{data}
argument.
}}

\item{post_cov}{A matrix, the hyper-posterior covariance parameter in
\code{magma}}

\item{pen_diag}{A number. A jitter term, added on the diagonal to prevent
numerical issues when inverting nearly singular matrices.}
}
\value{
A tibble, containing the trained hyper-parameters for the kernel of
the new individual/task.
}
\description{
Learning hyper-parameters of any new individual/task in \code{magma} is
required in the prediction procedure. This function can be used to learn the
hyper-parameters of a simple GP (just ignore the \code{post_cov} argument
and consider the \code{post_mean} argument as the  GP's mean parameter). When
using within \code{magma}, by providing data for the new individual/task,
the trained model (hyper-posterior mean and  covariance parameters) and
initialisation values for the hyper-parameters, the function computes
maximum likelihood estimates of the hyper-parameters.
