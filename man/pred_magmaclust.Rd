\arguments{
\item{data}{A tibble or data frame. Required columns: \code{Input},
\code{Output}. Additional columns for covariates can be specified.
The \code{Input} column should define the variable that is used as
reference for the observations (e.g. time for longitudinal data). The
\code{Output} column specifies the observed values (the response
variable). The data frame can also provide as many covariates as desired,
with no constraints on the column names. These covariates are additional
inputs (explanatory variables) of the models that are also observed at
each reference 'Input'.}

\item{trained_model}{A list, containing  the information coming from a
MagmaClust model, previously trained using the
\code{\link{train_magmaclust}} function. If \code{trained_model} is set to
NULL, the \code{hyperpost} and \code{prop_mixture} arguments are mandatory
to perform required re-computations for the prediction to succeed.}

\item{mixture}{A tibble or data frame, indicating the mixture probabilities
of each cluster for the new individual/task.
If NULL, the \code{\link{train_gp_clust}} function is used to compute
these posterior probabilities according to \code{data}.}

\item{hp}{A named vector, tibble or data frame of hyper-parameters
associated with \code{kern}. The columns/elements should be named
according to the hyper-parameters that are used in \code{kern}. The
\code{\link{train_gp_clust}} function can be used to learn
maximum-likelihood estimators of the hyper-parameters.}

\item{kern}{A kernel function, defining the covariance structure of the GP.
Several popular kernels
(see \href{https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/cookbook/}{The Kernel
Cookbook}) are already implemented and can be selected within the
following list:
\itemize{
\item "SE": (default value) the Squared Exponential Kernel (also called
Radial Basis Function or Gaussian kernel),
\item "LIN": the Linear kernel,
\item "PERIO": the Periodic kernel,
\item "RQ": the Rational Quadratic kernel.
Compound kernels can be created as sums or products of the above kernels.
For combining kernels, simply provide a formula as a character string
where elements are separated by whitespaces (e.g. "SE + PERIO"). As the
elements are treated sequentially from the left to the right, the product
operator '*' shall always be used before the '+' operators (e.g.
'SE * LIN + RQ' is valid whereas 'RQ + SE * LIN' is  not).
}}

\item{grid_inputs}{The grid of inputs (reference Input and covariates) values
on which the GP should be evaluated. Ideally, this argument should be a
tibble or a data frame, providing the same columns as \code{data}, except
'Output'. Nonetheless, in cases where \code{data} provides only one
'Input' column, the \code{grid_inputs} argument can be NULL (default) or a
vector. This vector would be used as reference input for prediction and if
NULL, a vector of length 500 is defined, ranging between the min and max
Input values of \code{data}.}

\item{hyperpost}{A list, containing the elements \code{mean}, \code{cov} and
\code{mixture} the parameters of the hyper-posterior distributions of the
mean processes. Typically, this argument should come from a previous
learning using \code{\link{train_magmaclust}}, or a previous prediction
with \code{\link{pred_magmaclust}}, with the argument \code{get_hyperpost}
set to TRUE.}

\item{prop_mixture}{A tibble or a named vector of the mixture proportions.
Each name of column or element should refer to a cluster. The value
associated with each cluster is a number between 0 and 1. If both
\code{mixture} and \code{trained_model} are set to NULL, this argument
allows to recompute mixture probabilities, thanks to the \code{hyperpost}
argument and the \code{\link{train_gp_clust}} function.}

\item{get_hyperpost}{A logical value, indicating whether the hyper-posterior
distributions of the mean processes should be returned. This can be useful
when planning to perform several predictions on the same grid of inputs,
since recomputation of the hyper-posterior can be prohibitive for high
dimensional grids.}

\item{get_full_cov}{A logical value, indicating whether the full posterior
covariance matrices should be returned.}

\item{plot}{A logical value, indicating whether a plot of the results is
automatically displayed.}

\item{pen_diag}{A number. A jitter term, added on the diagonal to prevent
numerical issues when inverting nearly singular matrices.}
}
\value{
A list of GP prediction results composed of:
\itemize{
\item pred: As sub-list containing, for each cluster:
\itemize{
\item pred_gp: A tibble, representing the GP predictions as two
column \code{Mean} and \code{Var}, evaluated on the
\code{grid_inputs}. The column \code{Input} and additional
covariates columns are associated with each predicted values.
\item proba: A number, the posterior probability associated with
this cluster.
\item cov (if \code{get_full_cov} = TRUE): A matrix, the full
posterior covariance matrix associated with this cluster.
}
\item mixture: A tibble, indicating the mixture probabilities
of each cluster for the predicted individual/task.
\item hyperpost (if \code{get_hyperpost} = TRUE): A list,
containing the hyper-posterior distributions information useful
for visualisation purposes.
}
}
\description{
Compute the posterior predictive distribution in MagmaClust.
Providing data from any new individual/task, its trained hyper-parameters
and a previously trained MagmaClust model, the multi-task posterior
distribution is evaluated on any arbitrary inputs that are specified through
the 'grid_inputs' argument. Due to the nature of the model, the prediction is
defined as a mixture of Gaussian distributions. Therefore the present
function computes the parameters of the predictive distribution
associated with each cluster, as well as the posterior mixture probabilities
for this new individual/task.
