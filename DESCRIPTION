Description: The MagmaClustR package implements two main algorithms, called
   Magma and MagmaClust, using a multi-task GPs model to perform
   predictions for supervised learning problems. Theses approaches leverage
   the learning of cluster-specific mean processes, which are common across
   similar tasks, to provide enhanced prediction performances (even far from
   data) at a linear computational cost (in the number of tasks).
   MagmaClust is a generalisation of Magma where the tasks are simultaneously
   clustered into groups, each being associated to a specific   mean process.
   User-oriented functions in the package are decomposed into
   training, prediction and plotting functions. Some basic features of
   standard GPs are also implemented.
